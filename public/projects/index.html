            My simple web server, written in C.
            Uses SQLite for routing table/other data and OpenSSL to make HTTPS connections.
            The site itself is hosted on an Amazon Lightsail instance, which just runs this server with my <a href="https://github.com/NeillJohnston/neilljohnston-com">frontend.</a>

            Two parts to it: the emulator interface (written in Lua) and the brain (written in C++).
            The interface reads the memory of the NES to figure out what the grid looks like, then sends this information to the brain in a separate process.
            The brains makes a decision and sends it back to the interface, then the interface puts some controller inputs in and slides the piece into place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decisions are evaluated by hand-written cost functions: a function takes in a grid state and outputs a number based on how desirable this state is.
            Almost every way of placing both the current piece and the next piece are considered - that means all rotations and positions including simple (one button press) tucks and spins.
            Comes out to only around 2000 future states per piece, which is a very reasonable search space.

            Right now I'm thinking of ways to improve it, and will almost certainly end up completing re-inventing this project.
            It was a lot of fun the first time.
