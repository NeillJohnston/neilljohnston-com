<h1 id="creating-this-site">Creating this site</h1>
<p>Nearing the end of my junior year in college, I still hadn't finished a side-project that I felt comfortable calling &quot;significant.&quot; All the things I wrote were either snippets of code, small toys, or incomplete. In the interest of changing that, I decided that I would finally make my own website, and make it as personalized as I could.</p>
<h2 id="choices">Choices</h2>
<p>The backend is written in C. I'm more familiar with C++, but wanted to go lower:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less standard library meant more things for me to write</li>
<li>No OOP meant having to structure code differently than I'm used to</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, everything that would normally make me run away from C for such a project made me turn to it. This was a project to teach me about <em>the nature of projects,</em> which felt impossible to learn without writing a lot in an unfamiliar setting.</p>
<h3 id="a-lot">A lot?</h3>

<p>You can always keep going lower and lower when making anything &quot;from scratch.&quot; I had to choose a stopping point, which meant balancing &quot;writing code for the sake of writing code&quot; and &quot;writing code for the sake of learning.&quot;</p>
<p>I ended up including 2 extra libraries - SQLite and OpenSSL. I didn't intend on writing my own database (that would be an entire project on its own), and I didn't intend on implementing a massive cryptography library just so I could get the little lock in the top-left of your browser.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sqlite3.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="programming-with-trust-issues">Programming with trust issues</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons I had such trouble sticking with projects was because I restarted constantly. It's really easy to get into the rhythm of writing massive amounts of code when you can fit the entire project in your head. So I would start, write for a day or two, then come back disgusted at what I had written because I had forgotten why I wrote it in the first place. Comments wouldn't fix this unless I wanted to comment every line (which I didn't).</p>
<p>As far as I know, this is a very common problem among programmers, and I felt like I had it in an extreme way. <em>I simply could not trust my past self to write anything.</em> That realization hit like a bus - once I realized that this was a core part of the problem, I could start taking steps to fix it (fun fact: this is my third time starting this project).</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>One easy way to be able to trust my old code was to make sure it was thoroughly.</p>
<p>The first thing I did for the project was shop around for a testing framework. I never found my Goldilocks testing framework - everything was either too light or too heavy - so I decided to just write my own. I knew that I would only use it for unit tests, so this boiled down to a <a href="https://github.com/NeillJohnston/web-server/blob/master/include/underscore.h">single header file</a> with a lot of macros and some pretty-printed output (using ANSI escape codes for different text colors).</p>
<p>Affectionately, I gave it a name. Uncreatively, it was &quot;underscore&quot;, because the macros I wrote had a lot of underscores. If you check out the web-server source, each directory in <code>/src/server</code> has a folder called <code>_</code>, that's where all the tests went.</p>
<p><em>(Side note: I don't really like naming my projects because it feels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ">silly</a> to christen something so insignificant, but I ended up really enjoying writing <code>#include &lt;underscore.h&gt;</code> on top of all my unit test files.)</em></p>
<h3 id="style">Style</h3>
<p>Pick one and stick with it. As I wrote more code and encountered more situations where I might feel like changing later, I added a rule to my own little style guide along with an explanation as to why that rule exists.</p>
