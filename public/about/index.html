<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, my name's Neill.</p>
<p>I'm going into my senior year of pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Florida. This summer I'll be a tech intern at Capital One (working virtually, stay safe). Previously I was a software engineering intern at a Gainesville-based startup called <a href="https://siteform.net/">SiteForm.</a></p>
<p>Right now I'm just trying to get employed as a software engineer, but I have at least a little interest in things like computer architecture, embedded systems, and programming language design - we'll see what the future holds.</p>
<p>I've been a member of the UF Programming Team for 2 years (competing at 2 ICPC regionals). Now as captain, I'll be involved with getting our new and old members ready to take down UCF this fall! Or more realistically FIT, but a man can dream. (I'm licensed to pick on FIT because Melbourne is my hometown.)</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about me as a programmer, check out my <a href="/projects">projects!</a> Or if you want to learn more about me as a person, feel free to send a message:</p>

<p>I'm also sort of active on <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler.</a> Loving math was half of what got me into CS and Project Euler has great problems, so I've been working my way through the archives since 2017.</p>
