# About Me

Hey there, my name's Neill.

I'm going into my senior year of pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Florida. This summer I'll be a tech intern at Capital One (working virtually, stay safe). Previously I was a software engineering intern at a Gainesville-based startup called [SiteForm.](https://siteform.net/)

Right now I'm just trying to get employed as a software engineer, but I have at least a little interest in things like computer architecture, embedded systems, and programming language design - we'll see what the future holds.

I've been a member of the UF Programming Team for 2 years (competing at 2 ICPC regionals). Now as captain, I'll be involved with getting our new and old members ready to take down UCF this fall! Or more realistically FIT, but a man can dream. (And I'm only picking on FIT because Melbourne is my hometown.)

If you want to learn more about me as a programmer, check out my [projects!](/projects) Or if you want to learn more about me as a person, feel free to send a message:

I'm also sort of active on [Project Euler.](https://projecteuler.net) Loving math was half of what got me into CS and Project Euler has great problems.
